# Guitar-Sound-Generator
Play a few chords recorded by my own guitar and watch the animations and chord names as you do!

*** IMPORTANT: PLEASE ALLOW AUDIO AND VIDEO IN YOUR BROWSER AND REFRESH TO LOAD WITH SOUND! ***

Just click the coloured bars at the bottom of the screen to see and hear the sounds of chords being played.

Original inspiration for this was from a tutorial, but it I have revamped and reworked it.

Specifically, I have recorded the sounds of my own guitar for use here and they are stored in the program as WAV files.

Quality of sound is not the best, but it is nicely functioning.
